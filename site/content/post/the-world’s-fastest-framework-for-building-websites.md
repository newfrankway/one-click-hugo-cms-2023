### Blistering Speed

What's modern about waiting for your site to build?

Hugo is the fastest tool of its kind. At <1 ms per page, the average site builds in less than a second.

### Robust Content Management

Flexibility rules. Hugo is a content strategist's dream.

Hugo supports unlimited content types, taxonomies, menus, dynamic API-driven content, and more, all without plugins.

### Shortcodes

Hugo's shortcodes are Markdown's hidden superpower.

We love the beautiful simplicity of markdown’s syntax, but there are times when we want more flexibility. Hugo shortcodes allow for both beauty and flexibility.

### Built-in Templates

Hugo has common patterns to get your work done quickly.

Hugo ships with pre-made templates to make quick work of SEO, commenting, analytics and other functions. One line of code, and you're done.

### Multilingual and i18n

Polyglot baked in.

Hugo provides full i18n support for multi-language sites with the same straightforward development experience Hugo users love in single-language sites.

### Custom Outputs

HTML not enough?

Hugo allows you to output your content in multiple formats, including JSON or AMP, and makes it easy to create your own.
